/**
 * Configuration file for: Hashing strength
 * This is the place where you define the strength of your password hashing/salting
 * 
 * To make password encryption very safe and future-proof, the PHP 5.5 hashing/salting functions
 * come with a clever so called COST FACTOR. This number defines the base-2 logarithm of the rounds of hashing,
 * something like 2^12 if your cost factor is 12. By the way, 2^12 would be 4096 rounds of hashing, doubling the
 * round with each increase of the cost factor and therefore doubling the CPU power it needs.
 * Currently, in 2013, the developers of this functions have chosen a cost factor of 10, which fits most standard
 * server setups. When time goes by and server power becomes much more powerful, it might be useful to increase
 * the cost factor, to make the password hashing one step more secure. Have a look here
 * (@see https://github.com/panique/php-login/wiki/Which-hashing-&-salting-algorithm-should-be-used-%3F)
 * in the BLOWFISH benchmark table to get an idea how this factor behaves. For most people this is irrelevant,
 * but after some years this might be very very useful to keep the encryption of your database up to date.
 * 
 * Remember: Every time a user registers or tries to log in (!) this calculation will be done.
 * Don't change this if you don't know what you do.
 * 
 * To get more information about the best cost factor please have a look here
 * @see http://stackoverflow.com/q/4443476/1114320
 * 
 * Those constants will be used in the login and the registration class.
 * 
 * For more info about constants please @see http://php.net/manual/en/function.define.php
 * If you want to know why we use "define" instead of "const" @see http://stackoverflow.com/q/2447791/1114320
